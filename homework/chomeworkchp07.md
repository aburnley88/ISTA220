1. What is a class? According to the book, what does a class “arrange?”

A class is a an arrangement of information and behavior into a meaningful entity.

2. What are the two purposes of encapsulatiohn?

To combine data and methods within a class; in other words, to support classification. 

3. How do you instantiate an instance of a class? How do you access that instance?

With the 'new' keywords c = new Circle(); 
This is a new instance of the circle class. 

4. What is the default access of the fields and methods of a class? How do you change the default?

The default access of the fields and methods of a class are private.

5. What is the syntax for writing a constructor?

Add a public method that does not return a value and give it the same name as the class. 

6. What is the difference between class fields and methods, and instance fields and methods? How do you
create class fields and methods?

You can only access instnace variables and methods through the instance of a class. You cannot access instnace variables and methods throught the class.

7. How do you bring a static class in scope? Why would you want to bring a static class in scope?

You bring a static class into scope with the class name. 

8. Can you think of a good reason to create an anonymous class? What is it?

As a container for information that will change but the structure will not. 

9. What is polymorphism as this term is used in computer science? This is not in the book.

n computer science, it describes the concept that objects of different types can be accessed through the same interface. Each type can provide its own, independent implementation of this interface.

10. What is message passing as this term is used in computer science? This is not in the book.

Message passing, in computer terms, refers to the sending of a message to a process which can be an object, parallel process, subroutine, function or thread.

11. What was the first object-oriented programming language?

Simula

12. Consider this quote by Alexander Stepanov:
I find OOP technically unsound. It attempts to decompose the world in terms of interfaces
that vary on a single type. To deal with the real problems you need multisorted algebras
— families of interfaces that span multiple types. I find OOP philosophically unsound. It
claims that everything is an object. Even if it is true it is not very interesting — saying that
everything is an object is saying nothing at all.
Who is Alexander Stephanov? What do you think about this quote?

Alexanderf Stephanov is a Russian programmer widely known for being the designer and implementer of C++ standard. 
I think this quote is beatiful in the sense that it shows that Stephanov longed for humanity and perhaps unpredictablity, randomness ,
and maybe something a little bit more.  Academically I actually disagree with him. OOP is designed to communicate with operating systems and 
not with human hearts.
