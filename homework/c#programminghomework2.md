1. A local variable is a variable that can only be used within
the method it was created. Within a scope (curly braces)

2. A statement is a command that performs an action.

3. Names that you use to identify the elements in your programs, such as namespaces, classes, methods, and variables.

4. 77 identifiers that C# reserves for its own use such as *abstract*, *double*, and *virtual*.

5. A storage location that holds a value. A variable is a named location in computer memory.

6. You declare a variable by naming it. You assign value with the equal to operator. Yes.Yes.

7. It makes its own solution and that could be a problem because it might not be the solution you need.

8. Types identify what operators can do.

9. By calling the ToString(); method.

10. By calling the TryParse method or the System.Convert class.

11.  Precedence governs the order in which an expression's operators are evaluated. Associativity is the direction (left or right), in which the operands of an operator are evaluated.

12. This rule is that variables need to have value before they are used or you will get an error.

13. Placing the operator symbol before the variable is called the *prefix* form of the operator, and using the operator symbol after the variable is called the *postfix* form. *Prefix* modifies and then evaluates and the *postfix* does the opposite; evaluates and then modifies.

14. String interpolation is a way to manipulate and alter strings.

15. The var keyword causes the compiler to deduce the type of variables from the types of the expressions used to initialize them.
